# ranger-gaian-plugin

**Introduction**

This plugin provides support for Ranger policies to be implemented when access data through Gaian.
For example:

* Permit/Deny access to Gaian Resources
* Supports Data Masking [tbd]
* Ranger Tag support (including being sourced from Apache Atlas) [tbd]

See doc/SQLBehaviour.md for example SQL statements and how they will behave

LIMITATIONS
 * Currently the user group determined is always 'users'

**Building the plugin**

Ensure the required build requirements are installed
* Java 8 (151 or above)
* Maven 3.50 or later

Next extract the source & build:

    `git clone https://github.com/GaianRangerPlugin/ranger-gaian-plugin.git`
    `cd ranger-gaian-plugin`
    `mvn clean install`

This should produce a plugin built in the 'target' directory called ranger-gaian-plugin-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar . 
This contains the plugin AND the dependent libraries.

NOTE: If you had an earlier version of this plugin you may have
dependent libraries in the policy directory. These are no longer required,
you ONLY need the jar file and the config files

**Running Unit Tests**

Unit tests are based on 'spock'.

Due to a current bug in the pom a) Tests do not run automatically from maven and b) To run within IntelliJ right click on 
plugin/src/test and click 'Mark Directory As -> Test Sources'. This will need to be redone if you refresh/reimport from maven. This will
be fixed in a later update. You can then navigate to plugin/src/test & open up the groovy/spock test file and run from there. Other
modules will be coded in a similar way



**Deploying the plugin to Gaian**

First modify the 'launchGaianServer.sh' script provided by Gaian to add additional directories to the classpath, which is where
we will install the plugin. The best place to do this is just before the section of code labelled 'automatic jar discovery' :

    `export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:/root/gaiandb/gaiandb/policy/*"`
    `export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:/root/gaiandb/gaiandb/policy/conf/"`

* copy plugin/target/ranger-gaian-plugin-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar from your build tree, to this policy folder on Gaian.

* Copy the configuration files found in this project under plugin/src/main/resources/conf to policy/conf on gaian. These are the configuration files
for the plugin which we will edit below

* configure Gaian to use RangerPolicyResultFilter, by adding this line at the end of gaiandb_config.properties:

    `SQL_RESULT_FILTER=org.apache.ranger.services.gaian.RangerPolicyResultFilter`

* configure Gaian to use Table Functions
    `MANAGE_LTVIEWS_WITH_TABLE_FUNCTIONS=true`
    
    Note that if this is changed when gaian is stopped there appears to be a bug whereby it is not picked up... Â in which case it can be forced by deleting the 'gaian' subdirectory which will cause views etc to be recreated..... I'll raise a separate issue on this in gaian GitHub.

**Deploying the Service Definition to Ranger**

This needs to be done once only (unless the service definition changes)

    `cd resources/service-defs`
    `curl -u admin:admin -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @ranger-servicedef-gaian.json http://localhost:6080/service/plugins/definitions`

Replace localhost with the IP /port of your Ranger Server

Once posted, the ranger access manager page should now show 'Gaian' as a selectable component

**Updating an existing service definition**

First delete any existing gaian services through the ranger UI

Then find out the id of the gaian servicedef. This would either have been returned when deployed, or
you can pull all definitions to find it ie

    `curl -u admin:admin localhost:6080/service/public/v2/api/servicedef/ | jsonpp | less`

'jsonpp' is one way to format a json file on macOS (installed using the 'brew' environment ie brew install jsonpp)

Look for gaian & then find the id....

To delete:

    `curl  -u admin:admin -X DELETE -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://9.20.65.115:6080/service/public/v2/api/servicedef/102`

**Configuring the Gaian plugin**

Modify the following files on gaian under policy/conf:

* ranger-gaian-audit.xml

    To use solr modify the property 'xasecure.audit.solr.is.enabled' to true, and set the correct hostname/solr endpoint in xasecure.audit.solr.solr_url

    Alternatively to log directly to a RDBMS such as mysql modify the property 'xasecure.audit.db.is.enabled' to true, and set the correct hostname/db uri in xasecure.audit.jpa.javax.persistence.jdbc.url

* ranger-gaian-security.xml

    In order for the gaian plugin to be able to retrieve policies, we must specify the REST endpoint. If this is
    incorrect, or there is no access (firewall etc) ranger policies will not be updated/work
    
    Specify this in the ranger.plugin.gaian.policy.rest.url property
    
    Do not change the property ranger.plugin.gaian.service.name and leave it set to 'gaian'
    
* log4J.properties

    This is a simple example to outlog debug logs to the console. Modify as required. It is likely helpful for debugging
    in this stage of development, but in an eventual deployment log4j.properties would likely be deployed elsewhere in the 
    environment

**Adding support for User Impersonation**

The impersonation/ directory provides a module to allow a valid gaian user to assert that they are in fact
acting on behalf of another user, which does not need to be pre-configured in gaian. This allows
Ranger policies to operate on behalf of a end-user rather than a generic service account.

To install this support 

* copy the jar

    Copy impersonation/target/gaian-impersonation-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to the 'policy' directory in Gaian (the same directory where you 
    added the ranger plugin)
    
* modify derby.properties

    Change the auth class in the configuration similar to as follows (the old entry is commented out):
    
    `#derby.authentication.provider=com.ibm.gaiandb.GaianAuthenticator`
    `derby.authentication.provider=org.apache.derby.authentication.UserAuthenticator`
    
Check gaian works by starting it. If the support is not installed gaian will fail to start with many errors, and
in gaiandb.log you will find an entry stating:

    `2018-02-22 14:32:54.780 ********** GDB_WARNING: ENGINE_JDBC_CONN_ATTEMPT_ERROR: Failed JDBC Connection attempt in 172 ms for: jdbc:derby:gaiandb;create=true, cause: java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Connection refused : FATAL: There is no Authentication Service for the system; Common issues: missing jdbc driver, network/database unavailability (e.g. firewall), incorrect user/password and/or insufficient database access rights (e.g. if derby.database.defaultConnectionMode=noAccess in derby.properties)`

If this is seen check the jar file, properties entry, classpath & location ...

To make use of this support connect to the database with properties set as follows:
* User

The user that derby/gaian should act on behalf of, once authentication is completed

* Password

If proxy-user/pwd is not used this is the password of the User. 
If not, it has to be specified as a non null string, but is ignored

* proxy-user

Specifies the service account (aka NPA) to authenticate as

* proxy-pwd

Specifies the proxy account's password

So for example instead of using a string similar to
    `jdbc:derby://localhost:6414/gaiandb;user=gaiandb;password=passw0rd`
Use
    `jdbc:derby://localhost:6414/gaiandb;user=nigel;password=x;proxy-user=gaiandb;proxy-pwd=passw0rd`

After authentication derby/gaian will see the user as 'nigel' even though gaiandb/passw0rd is the user/pass setup in gaian.
Therefore ranger policies can be used that refer to 'nigel' or the groups they are a member of (when implemented)

Note that with this plugin installed 
* you can still use the original way of connecting as a generic user
* with either method the service user specified must have the correct password provided    


**Verifying the environment**

(tbd)
    
**Creating Ranger Policies**

* Create a ranger service def by logging onto the Ranger UI and selecting resource policies. You should see a section labelled 'Gaian'. Create a new instance of a Gaian service. You MUST use the name 'gaian'. Tag service can be left blank for now, and whilst user/password have to be filled in, they
will be ignored.



**Testing Policies**

* A quick test:
0. Run testGaianDB.sh, it should show an empty table.
1. Create a policy of schema *, table LT0, column * on Ranger UI.
2. run testGaianDB.sh, it should show table LT0 correctly.

* Test with specific column query:
For this to be able to work correctly, must use derby virtual table syntax. For example, if only query column LOCATION in table LT0, the syntax is:

select firstname,lastname,birth_date from TABLE(VEMPLOYEE('VEMPLOYEE')) VEMP FETCH FIRST 100 rows only

and then create column access/deny policies for testing.


**Todos**

* Add Masking support to plugin
* Add tag support to plugin
* Add proxy auth module
* Add info on verifying environment
* Add info on debugging/logging
* Create a 'dist' directory or similar with the two relevant jars + instructions + servicedef + policy configuration files
* check dependency versions. some are back level, though it may depend what ranger built with
