**Atlas configuration for Gaian resources**

This directory contains 'AtlasGaianTypes.json' which provides base Atlas types for 
Gaian resources, modelled on the types used by Hive (but simplified)

These types are those used by the current modifications to Ranger tagsync which can be found in the 
same git organization as this plugin project.

This directory also contains 'AtlasGaianEntitySample.json' which provides some example resource 
definitions for experimentation

Both can be pushed to the server using curl or a tool such as 'postman'
